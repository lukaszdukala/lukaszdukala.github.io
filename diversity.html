			<h1>Longyearbyen: the heart of Svalbard society</h1>

			<h2>Like a small Norwegian municipality</h2>
			<p>There are currently approximately 2 600 people settled on Svalbard. This approximation is due to some uncertainty in the figures. For instance, there are more people resident on Svalbard in the summer months than in the winter ones. <em>Resident</em> here means all those living in the archipelago and who
			intend to stay for more than 6 months. In the early 1980s, when the number of residents was at its highest, the majority consisted of some 4 000 resident Russians. From the early 1990s, the numbers of both Russians and Norwegians fell. Since then, the number of Russians has continued to fall, while the number of Norwegians has increased. Today just over 1 700 Norwegians, around 300 Ukrainians and only some 100 Russians live on Svalbard.</p>
			</p>
			
			<h2>From near and far</h2>
			<p>The Norwegian population is largely recruited from the counties of Troms
			and Nordland, which contribute nearly 30 per cent. There is in addition a large and increasing number of foreign residents: nearly 500 people from some 40 countries, the majority from <strong>Thailand</strong>,<strong> Sweden</strong>,<strong> Ukraine</strong>,<strong> Russia</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>,<strong> Spain</strong>, and <strong>Germany</strong>. The share of foreigners in the Norwegian settlement has increased to 22 per cent.</p>
			
		

			<h2>Concentrated settlement</h2>
			<p>Svalbard&rsquo;s population is mainly concentrated in two settlements: Norwegians in Longyearbyen and Ukrainians and Russians in Barentsburg. Most of the other foreign citizens also live in Longyearbyen. There are also around 25 permanent residents at Ny-Alesund.</p>

			<h2>Large turnover</h2>
			<p>Svalbard has been characterised as a &lsquo;churn society&rsquo;, and Longyearbyen has a much greater turnover than a Norwegian municipality of similar size. There are large numbers of both arrivals and departures: in 2013, just over 450 departures were recorded, corresponding to around 20 per cent of the population. The average length of residence in Longyearbyen is seven years â€“ slightly longer for Norwegian residents and somewhat shorter for the foreign ones. However, there is of course huge variation in how long people stay here. While some just stay for a year or two, others are more permanent residents. At the start of 2014, for example, a good quarter had moved to Svalbard before the year 2005. It is mining employees in particular who reside on Svalbard for a long time. Employees in local administration also stay for relatively long periods. Students, employees in higher education and the tourism industry and government employees have far shorter periods of residence.
