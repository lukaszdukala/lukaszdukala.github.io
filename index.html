				<p>People who live outside the Arctic are generally impressed by its vastness and apparent emptiness. They often think of it as a wilderness, hostile to human life.Yet small communities of humans have lived in this region for thousands of years, moving across these spaces in regular cycles as they follow the animals with which their lives are closely involved.</p>
				<p>The Arctic is the harshest environment on Earth - little food grows, it&rsquo;s dark for months and temperatures stay well below freezing for much of the year. Yet four million people manage to live and survive in the Arctic. 
				Though among the worldÂ’&rsquo;s harshest environments, the Arctic is full of life.
				When most people think of the Arctic or the North Pole, they imagine a flat, treeless, ice- and snow-covered landscape where few things can live. While it is true that much of the region is made up of ice floating on the ocean and land that is permanently frozen (permafrost), the Arctic is in fact home to diverse plants, animals, and microorganisms. In order to survive, people had to adapt to their cold, harsh surroundings. They learned which mammals, birds, and fish to hunt for food and other uses.

			<h1><strong> No longer isolated from the rest of the world! </strong></h1>
			<p>Svalbard was for a long time an extremely isolated society. In 1911, the Norwegian authorities had established Spitsbergen Radio and for many years all regular contact between Svalbard and the rest of the world was by radio wave or ship. The civil airport, Svalbard Airport, Longyear, only became operational in 1975, after Soviet protests had blocked plans for an airport in the1950s. Today, Longyearbyen is the northernmost place in the world to have regular scheduled air services.In 1978, Svalbard was connected to the phone network via three channels on a satellite connection, and in 1984, the archipelago received direct TV broadcasts from the Norwegian state broadcaster (NRK) for the first time. Prior to this, inhabitants of Longyearbyen were only able to view two-week
			old programmes supplied on video tape. In 2003, Svalbard was connected to the Norwegian mainland via two fibre-optic submarine cables which provide broadband and other telecommunications services. Almost all households, that is 97%, now have a broadband internet connection, compared with just 80% in mainland Norway.




			<h2> Have you ever heard of Svalbard? If so, how much do you know about it?</h2>
			<p>The Svalbard Islands are located in the Arctic Ocean, halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Here you will find untouched arctic wilderness.<br />

			<p>Svalbard is a group of islands situated at 76 to 80 degrees north, close to the arctic ice.

			Most of the islands is arctic wilderness, dominated by mountains, fjords, glaciers and arctic wildlife, but there are a few settlements.

			The main settlement is the town of Longyearbyen with daily planes from Norway. The 2500 citizens is occupied by coal mining, tourism and scientific or educational work.

			Svalbard is Norwegian, but there is also a Russian mining town called Barentsburg, and a Polish research station.</p>

				<h1>10 things you might NOT know about Svalbard at all</h1>
				
				<ul>
			<li><strong>Longyearbyen was founded by an American</strong> </li>
				<p>An American, John Longyear, started the Arctic Coal Company and set up a mining operation for around 500 people in 1906. The settlement was known as Longyear City. Today it is Longyearbyen, meaning Longyear City in Norwegian.</p>
			<li><strong> Longyearbyen is built on stilts.</strong></li>
				<p>The ground in Svalbard is permafrost, which means the soil is permanently frozen year round. In Longyearbyen the permafrost ranges from 10 to 40 meters deep, with an active layer that melts each summer as the temperatures rise above freezing. The slilts, or piles, keep the building away from the active layer to prevent flooding and sinking!</p>
			<li><a href="diversity.html"><strong>The most culturally diverse Arctic settlement!</strong></a></li>
				<p>What is surprising to hear is that despite its tiny population there are <strong>over 40 different nationalities</strong> in Svalbard. More and more recently people have come from all corners of the world to call this unique and remote place their home. One of the more common nationalities and the biggest minority on the Island is <u>Thai</u> which I found interesting, and because of this you&rsquo;ll be able to find a popular Thai restaurant on the main street in Longyearbyen.</p>

<blockquote>John Munroe Longyear
(1850-1922) came to Svalbard
on a cruise in 1901 and became
interested in the coal-mining
prospects. In 1906, through The
Arctic Coal Company, he acquired
mining rights from a Norwegian
company and Longyear City was
founded. In 1915, the mining
operation was wound up, and in
1916 it was sold on to the newly
founded Store Norske Spitsbergen
Kulkompani AS.
</blockquote>
			<li><strong>Check your gun at the door!</strong></li>
				<p>More than 3,000 polar bears live around Svalbard; they are curious and sometimes hungry after not eating for months at a time. It is required to carry and know how to use a high-powered rifle anytime you leave the settlement.While it became a usual sight to see everyone casually walking about town with a rifle slung over their shoulder, guns are not allowed inside any building.</p>
			<li> <strong> Snow scooters are the preferred mode of transportation</strong></li>
				<p>There are no roads outside of the settlements of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Ny-Alesund and the roads do not connect the settlements with each other. Snowmobiles, called snow scooters in Svalbard, are crucial for transportation in the long winter months. They are so crucial, in fact, that there are 4,000 snow scooters for Longyearbyen&rsquo;s 2,000 residents.</p>

			<li><strong>The sun does not rise for 4 months!</strong></li>
				<p>The sun sets each year for the very last time on October 25th and it will not rise above the horizon again for four months. The sun officially returns to Longyearbyen on March 8th, when it is finally high enough above the horizon to illuminate the steps of the old hospital. Solfestuka is a week long celebration to welcome the return of the sun and the entire town gathers on the steps of the old hospital at precisely 12:15 to await its arrival.</p>

			<li><strong>You can&rsquo;t have a cat as a pet.</strong></li>
				<p>You won&rsquo;t find cat food at the local co-op. Svalbard is home to abundant Arctic bird populations and cats pose a problem for the bird life. So Svalbard has prohibited them.</p>
			<li><strong>Reindeer wander through town.</strong></li>
				<p>The Svalbard reindeer have no natural predators and so are very docile animals. They wander right through town and aren&rsquo;t generally bothered by people being nearby.</p>
			<li><strong>The biggest seed bank can be found in Spitsbergen!</strong></li>
				<p> The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a secure seed bank on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen near Longyearbyen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago, about 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) from the North Pole.</p>

			<li><strong>It is <u>illegal</u> to die.</strong></li>
				<p>Yes, you read the right! Death is forbidden. Longyearbyen only has a small graveyard that stopped accepting new burials over 70 years ago. Why? Because the bodies <u>never</u> decompose. Scientists found that bodies are perfectly preserved because of the permafrost. So if you&rsquo;re going to die, go do it somewhere else. It&rsquo;s the law!</p>
