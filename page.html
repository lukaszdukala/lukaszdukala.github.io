<h1> Welcome to my world! </h1>
<h2> What is it all about? </h2>
<p> This is a Hyper Island project where I am not only challenging myself by learning coding but also challenging my classmates' belief of something.</p> <br>
<p>This is going to be super duper exciting! What we do here at Hyper Island is basically learning by making fools of ourselves in public. Bring it on! <p>
